## Goals
- Using the app is better than using regular conversational methods
	- It must be just as easy, but ALSO do money tracking.

## Path
- Complete 'Show Balance' and 'Repay' plugins
- Stress test and solidify ordering plugins (there seem to be bugs with people adding items or items not being found?)
- Build default coffee shop with prices, add way to add specifically a coffee shop
- Genericise plugins to be db-agnostic, so it can be unplugged from the keystone backend.
